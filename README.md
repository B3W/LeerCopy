# LeerCopy

Application for quickly and accurately capturing your screen.

Leer Copy is a screen capturing application developed in C#. Similar to the function of the infamous Snipping Tool but with added features for
usability and customization for a little extra flair. Once you have a prime section of screen selected you can: copy to the clipboard, edit in
your default editor, or save to a .PNG file. Not satisfied with the selected section? No problem! Use the arrow keys to resize your selection
to your liking or clear it out and start over.

In the near future I will add the ability to change the shortcut keys to your liking (currently the WASD area is being utilized) as well as
some sort of 'popup preview' so you can confirm the accuracy of the selection. Nothing bugged me more than having to start an entire Snip over
after realizing I just missed out on something I wanted include in the capture. Eventually I will also probably include a feature to capture
an application window via clicking on it.

Source code includes main method, main form, settings form, application manifest, and WIX installer.

I enjoyed creating Leer Copy and I hope you enjoy it's utility!
